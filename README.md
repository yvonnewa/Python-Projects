# Python-Projects

Author: Yvonne Wang

A collection of projects for my CMPT 120 class.

## What is assignment3turtle?

assignment3turtle is a drawing of various shapes and structures I created while learning how to use the Turtle module.

## What is myfoodbot2?

myfoodbot2 is a menu for a fictitious restaurant that serves Italian and Vietnamese dishes. Users can choose what they want to eat and find out the total for their meal.

## What is myinvestor1?

myinvestor1 is a bot that calculates fictitious investment returns for the user based on their initial investment and the number of years they plan to invest for.

## How do I run the programs?

Be sure that [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (I use version 3.7.4) and [PythonTurtle](http://pythonturtle.org/) is installed on your computer. You can also run the programs with [repl.it](http://repl.it/) and select the appropriate languages.
