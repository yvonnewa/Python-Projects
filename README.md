# Python-Projects

Author: Yvonne Wang

A collection of projects for my CMPT 120 class.

## How do I run the programs?

Be sure that [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (I used version 3.7.4) and [PythonTurtle](http://pythonturtle.org/) is installed on your computer. You can also run the programs with [repl.it](http://repl.it/) and select the appropriate languages.
